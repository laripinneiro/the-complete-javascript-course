# JavaScript Fundamentals - Part I

## A Brief Introduction to JavaScript

JavaScript is a high level, object-oriented, multi-paradigm programming language.

- **Programming Language:** instruct computer to do things;

- **High-level:** we don't have to worry about complex stuff like memory management;

- **Object-oriented:** based on objects, for storing most kind of data;

- **Multi-paradigm:** we can use different styles of programming, such as imperative (how to do things) and declarative (what to do) programming.

We can use JS to build front-end apps, like create dynamic effects and web applications in the browser, back-end apps, like web applications on web server, and native mobile or desktop applications.
