# JavaScript Fundamentals - Part I

## A Brief Introduction to JavaScript

JavaScript is a high level, object-oriented, multi-paradigm programming language.

- **Programming Language:** instruct computer to do things;

- **High-level:** we don't have to worry about complex stuff like memory management;

- **Object-oriented:** based on objects, for storing most kind of data;

- **Multi-paradigm:** we can use different styles of programming, such as imperative (how to do things) and declarative (what to do) programming.

We can use JS to build front-end apps, like create dynamic effects and web applications in the browser, back-end apps, like web applications on web server, and native mobile or desktop applications.

## Values and Variables

A **value** is basically the smallest unit of information that we have in JS, and **variable** stores the data value, that can be changed along scripting. When we declare a variable, there are some naming conventions:

- **camelCase:** when we have different words, those in the middle of the name begins with a capital letter;

- **numbers:** the name can receive numbers, but cannot be the first character;

- **symbols:** the only symbols that the name can receive are underscore and dollar sign;

- **keywords:** we cannot name a variable with JS keywords.

## Data Types

JS has primitive and reference types, the difference between is that when we have primitive types variable holds its actual value, but if it's a reference type the variable holds only references to the value.

JS has seven primitive data types: **number**, **string**, **boolean**, **undefined** (empty value), **null** (empty value with assignment), **symbol** and **bigInt**. Also it has dynamic typing so we don't have to manually define a value data type and we can change variable's value and its type.

If we wanna know the type of a value we can use **typeof**, like this:

```js
let a = 10;
console.log(typeof a); // number
console.log(typeof "javascript"); // string
```

## Let, Const and Var

- **Var** - a variable declared with VAR operator are accesible by the lower scopes. Also, those declared within block scopes are hoisted to the global scope. But remember, VAR operator actually it's a bit of an outdated Syntex from now.

- **Let** - similar to VAR operator, a variable declared with LET is accesible by the lower scopes. But unlike VAR, those declared within block scopes are not hoisted. This is the correct and current way of declaring a variable.

- **Const** - variables declared with CONST operator cannot have their values changed during scripting. So if we know that something should never change, we must declare it with CONST so we get an error if we do accidentally change it.
